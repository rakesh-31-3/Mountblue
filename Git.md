What is git?
 Git is a **distributed version control** system that tracks changes in files and enables collaboration among developers. It’s a popular tool for software development, used by over 90% of professional developers.
 Git Featues:
  1.Distributed: Each developer has a local copy of the entire project history, known as a “repository” (or “repo”). This allows them to work offline and      synchronize changes later.
  2.Version control: Git tracks changes to files, allowing you to recall specific versions or iterations of your project.
  3.Branching and merging: Developers can create separate branches to work on features or fixes, and then merge their changes with the main branch (e.g.,  “master”).
  4.Concurrency: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the project simultaneously, without conflicts.
  5.Attributable changes: Each commit (change) is attributed to a specific developer, making it easy to track who made changes and when.
  6.Reverting: You can easily revert to a previous version of the project if needed.

 1.Repository: A repository commonly refered as repo and it's a collection of a source code.A repository has commits to the project or set of a commits to the.
 2.Commit: A commit logs the change or series of changes in the repo(source code).A commit has a unique SHA1 hash which is used to keep track of files changed in the past. A series of commits comprises the Git history.
 3.Branches: A branch is essentially a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the branch where all the changes eventually get merged into - is called the master or main. This is the official working version of your project and the one that you will see when you visit the project repository at github.com/yourname/projectname.

1.Version Controll System:
  1.Centralized: in the Centralized system all the members are connected with Centralized server to get the leatest copy of the code. so if the server get into offline then we can't able to access it we need to wait untill it's get onlined.
  2.Distributed: in the Distributed system every team member have the copy of the project on their machine.so they can able to work separetly and able to merge into the signle file using the git,mercurial
